Top bar: about me  .... Portfolio & search bar

- same top bar for every subpage

- main page will decide later

-About me page will be similar to the https://nextjs-notion-starter-kit-eight-steel.vercel.app/





day1:
    commit 1:  - top nav bar component
               - basic structures
               - fonts
    problems: top bar look like shit when not enough space is provided,
"About me" is wrapped into two lines which shares with "Portfolio".
